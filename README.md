# odin-recipes
## Introduction
In this first project I will be implementing the HTML and Git skills I have been learning about to create a basic webpage.

This webpage will be built up from scratch to eventually contain hyperlinks to several recipes as well as associated images.

During the creation process, regular commits will be made to familiarise myself with the modify-stage-commit cycle.
