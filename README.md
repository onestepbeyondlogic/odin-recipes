# odin-recipes
## Introduction
In this first project I will be implementing the HTML and Git skills I have been learning about to create a basic webpage.

This webpage will be built up from scratch to eventually contain hyperlinks to several recipes as well as associated images.

During the creation process, regular commits will be made to familiarise myself with the modify-stage-commit cycle.

## Reflection
I found this introductory project to be really enjoyable! I certainly felt like I developed and cemented my understanding around the use of websites as 'a navigatable file system' and the Git modify-stage-commit cycle.

My key takeaways were:
- At first I thought that I'd struggle with using the "imperative mood" in git commit messages but it soon felt natural
- The structure of commit messages also took a bit of getting used to but soon felt natural and helpful
- I managed to use the <em> and <strong> tags in (what felt like) appropriate ways
- I better understand how to stage files such that commits are meaningful and only contain the most relevant files to that commit
- I better understand how to implement images on a webpage as well as anchor tags (including anchors that make use of the "id" attribute as in the Spaghetti Bolognese page)
- Choosing exactly when to commit is still something that will likely take some experience to get the hang of
- Unsplash is a very cool site!
