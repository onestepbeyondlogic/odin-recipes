    <h1>Simple Salad</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        According to the <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/salad">Cambridge Dictionary</a> a salad is:
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>"A mixture of uncooked vegetables, usually including lettuce, eaten either as a separate dish or with other food"</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        Ok so the picture may be a <em>bit</em> of an oversimplification of this recipe, but really not by much. This recipe is also from my student days and was an occasional 'light meal' used to break up the copious helpings of spaghetti bolognese.
