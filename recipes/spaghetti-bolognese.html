        According to <a href="https://www.takeaway.com/foodwiki/italy/spaghetti-bolognese/">TAKE AWAY</a>:

    <p>
        <em>"Spaghetti bolognese consists of spaghetti (long strings of pasta) with an Italian rag√π (meat sauce) made with minced beef, bacon and tomatoes, served with Parmesan cheese. Spaghetti bolognese is one of the most popular pasta dishes eaten outside of Italy."</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        There are many recipes out there (and many that dodge authenticity) but, in my humble opinion, as long as it tastes nice and doesn't give you food poisoning, you can't go too far wrong.
    </p>

    <p>
        The following recipe is one that places itself squarely in the <strong>un-authentic</strong> camp. It is the recipe I came up with as a student as a quick and cheap method to batch 4-6 servings of home comfort food.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Beef Mince - 750g packet (15% Fat)</li>
        <li>Mushroom Stir Fry Mix - 1 bag</li>
        <li>Family Size Dolmio Bolognese Sauce</li>
        <li>Dried Spaghetti</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>Olive Oil</li>
        <li id="seasonings"><em>Optionally:</em></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Garlic Powder</li>
            <li>Onion Powder</li>
            <li>Mixed Italian Herbs</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add a large saucepan of water to the stove, season heavily with salt and bring it to a rolling boil</li>
        <li>Whilst waiting for the water to boil add a frying pan to the stove with a couple of tablespoons of oil on medium heat</li>
        <li>Add the mince to the frying pan and use a spatula to break it up and flip it as it browns</li>
        <li>Once browned (or grey-ed) add the bag of stir fry mix and heavily season with salt to extract the water from the veg. Stir everything in</li>
        <li>Once the water has reached a rolling boil, add as much spaghetti as you like (4-6 servings)</li>
        <li>Once the veg has wilted sufficiently, add the jar of Dolmio sauce <em>tip: you can add a splash of water to the jar and rinse the last dregs of sauce out and into the pan</em></li>
        <li>Thoroughly incorporate the meat, sauce and veg</li>
        <li>At this point you can also add <a href="#seasonings">any additional seasonings</a> to the sauce, to taste</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to low and leave to simmer for 10-15 minutes</li>
        <li>Once the spaghetti is nearly (but not quite) finished, strain all but about a cup of the pasta water and add it to the bolognese sauce</li>
        <li>Allow the pasta to finish cooking in the bolognese, adding the reserved pasta water as necessary to create a glossy sauce</li>
        <li>Divide into meal prep containers, optionally garnish with parmesan and basil and dig in!</li>
    </ol>
